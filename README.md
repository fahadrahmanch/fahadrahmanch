      <h2>About Me</h2>
<p>
  Hey, I'm Fahad ‚Äî a MERN Stack Developer who turned curiosity into a daily coding habit.<br />
  I started in Instrumentation Engineering, but soon realized my real interest was in building things on the web.<br />
  Now, I spend most of my time writing code, learning new concepts, and improving my skills in JavaScript, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and React.<br />
  I believe small consistent steps lead to big achievements ‚Äî and that‚Äôs exactly how I‚Äôm growing as a developer.<br />
  Whether it's front-end design or back-end logic, I love turning ideas into real, working applications.
</p>
